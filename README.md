# booklistwebsite
Website designed to track all the books I've read since late December of 2018. The reason for tracking all the books I've read is because I find it fascinating to know at what times during the year I've read books at. Currently, I do have a text file full of the books I've read and at what intervals of time it took to read them, but I wanted to create a website because A) it is far better looking than a text file, B) I want to improve my coding and challenge myself, which can be expressed through creating this website, and C) re-read the first sentence, I enjoy looking at everything I've read.
